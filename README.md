Some time ago I stumbled upon [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler/blob/master/README.md) project and an rewrite of the project in [Go](https://github.com/hazbo/the-super-tiny-compiler). I thought I should give it a try in Python and here it is.

## Usage

```python
```

## Tests

Run with `node test.js`
